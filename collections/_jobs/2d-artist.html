job-title: 2D Artist
job-type: Contractor, part time
job-location: Remote
job-duration: 1-2 months
job-intro:
    At Torpedo Software, we put a lot of focus on our community's ability to socialize and support one another.
    In Lua Learning, users can leave "awards" on posts that they like, which leaves the award's image on the post for all to see and gifts coins to the post's author. (Similar to Reddit's award system.)
    We're looking to expand the repertoire of awards that players can use, and need a talented 2D artist to draw them!
job-desc:
    As the 2D artist, you'll play a critical role in expanding our product's visual assets.
    You will work alongside our Lua Learning team to create award images, creating both static images and animated images.
    You'll adapt and adjust the artwork to fit our design vision and artstyle. Additionally, you will ensure that all content is
    readable at small resolutions.
