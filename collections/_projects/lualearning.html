<h2>Lua Learning</h2>
<p>Lua Learning is a free-to-use platform for interactive learning in a Roblox game.
With an in-game IDE, custom curriculum, and sandboxed code execution, students and inquiring minds can learn by doing. Lessons, quizzes, quests, tutorials, and more!</p>

<p>Our founder, Zack Ovits, created Lua Learning in 2018. He worked on it all by himself for four long years,
accumulating <span class="accent">millions of visits</span>, the <span class="accent">#1 Top Rated PC Game</span> on the Roblox games page, and earning the
<span class="accent">Most Educational Game</span> in the 2020 Bloxy Awards.
<br>He knew it was time to step it up, so he built Torpedo Software to help him do so.

<p>Lua Learning is founded upon three unwavering principles:</p>
<li><span class="accent">Interactive learning.</span> The best way to learning programming is by doing. Lua Learning focuses
on keeping content interactive, allowing users to write and run code as they learn to help them utilize & internalize their new knowledge.</li>
<li><span class="accent">Community collaboration.</span> There are many people who have knowledge to share, and Lua Learning gives them a
platform to do so. Users can submit their own tutorials into Lua Learning, and other users can comment, vote, and even award them.</li>
<li><span class="accent">Accessible to all.</span> This means that all its content is freely available,
runs perfectly on low end devices, supports disabilities and special needs, and is translated into many languages.
Utilizing Roblox's Open Cloud, the community tutorial content is also available on
<a href="https://www.lualearning.org/tutorials/discover">lualearning.org</a> to further ensure that the content is
accessible to everyone, everywhere, all the time. This goes hand in hand with our community collaboration principle,
as we want to let everyone into our wonderful community.</li>
